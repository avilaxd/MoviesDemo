MoviesDemo is a demo project developed by me (Armando √Åvila Bueno) as part of my resume in order to show recruiters the way 
I code and the knowledge I have about Android development.

The app shows a list of recent movies and if you click on one of those movies it'll take you to the detail of that movie, 
displaying stuff like title, rating, synopsis, cast members and some images related to the movie. It gets its data from the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org) API.
The app is entirely written in Kotlin following the MVVM pattern.

The project is meant to keep updating with new features, implementing best practices and the latests Android technologies.

## Project Setup

Setup should be pretty straight forward, you'll only need Android Studio 3.5 or later to open the project and an Android 
device/emulator running Android 21+ if you want to install it.
